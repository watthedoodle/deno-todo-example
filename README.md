# Deno todo example

A simple example of building a complete `todo` web application using Deno and
`Hono` web framework.

In this example we create the backend API in Deno, and the front end is simply a
static `index.hml` file using raw/vanilla JavaScript.

## Running

After cloning down, in the root directory simply invoke the following:

```shell
$ deno task run
```

(this assumes you have Deno locally installed). No other dependencies are
needed.
